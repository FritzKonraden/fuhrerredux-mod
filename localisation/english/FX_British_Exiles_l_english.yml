bex.0.t:0 "The Exiles Arrive"
bex.0.d:0 "With the fall of the Home Isles to socialism, the Port of Alexandria has been overwhelmed by a flood of refugees, soldiers, evacuated military equipment and ships. Little of the civilian government escaped, with Westminster surrounded throughout the crisis. The seige was finally broken with the collapse of forces on the mainland, with much of the civilian government now dead or in prison. With little other real authority remaining, a military government has assumed control in Cairo, with the King a mere figurehead of the decapitated British Empire. The new government seeks to keep the collapsing British Empire together, while other powers and independence movements circle the remains like vultures, with much of the Empire without any real military precence able to defend its territory. The government and its rapidly growing British population remain in good spirits however, with Haig's Special Order from the days of the Great War now continually invoked: ‘There is no other course open to us but to fight it out. Every position must be held to the last man: there must be no retirement. With our backs to the wall and believing in the justice of our cause each one of us must fight on to the end. The safety of our homes and the freedom of mankind alike depend upon the conduct of each one of us at this critical moment.’"
bex.0.a:0 "Attlee hasn't seen the last of us!"

bex.1.t:0 "The Paris Conference"
bex.1.d:0 "With the fall of the Home Isles to socialism, the words on every diplomats lips is 'The Imperial Question', of what remains of the British Empire and the potential of the government in London to establish its authority in these lands. To address this, the French government has called the 'Paris Conference', bringing major and minor powers throughout the world together with the aim of dividing up what they can of the British Empire under the guise of stopping socialism. A plan was rapidly drawn up over a few days, and now forces march across frontiers across the globe to translate these plans into reality. This has gone by with almost no opposition, with British garrisons either returned to the Home Isles before the Civil War or now under the Cairo Government. Much of what has been left is in anarchy, and the government in Cairo struggles to assert authority over what is left."
bex.1.a:0 "What a disaster!"

bex.2.t:0 "Territories fall to independence movements"
bex.2.d:0 "What remained of the British Empire outside the control of the Cairo Government has now fallen to local nationalists. Tanganyika, Oman and Malaya have fallen to independence movements. The British Empire outside of the dominions has been reduced to Egypt, the Anglo-Eygptian Sudan, Uganda and Kenya. The situation in these territories is stable for now, but we have a long way to go before our rule is cemented and we can begin on the long road to reclaiming the homeland."
bex.2.a:0 "The sun sets..."

bex.3.d:0 "The British Isles have fallen to socialism and we are now watching the rapid collapse of the British Empire. To our North is Canada, long a British possession we have eyed hungrily, and now the British authority has collapsed. Now an independent nation, there is no one to protect Canada if we were to declare its annexation..."

bex.4.d:0 "Many at home do not approve of the change in government, and valiantly fought to stop it from occuring. Unfortunately, they were not victorious, but now they are getting onto boats en masse and smuggling themselves out of the country to get to us! We now see what was a difficult situation in Egypt, the Sudan, Kenya and Uganda improving as more and more British men and women populate these lands!"

bex.5.d:0 "We have struggled to control the boundaries of our nation with the chaos post revolution, and as a result reactionaries are leaving in the thousands to escape to the Cairo Government. While this is seeing a drain on our population and resources, it is helping to stabilise the situation at home as the reactionary dissidents are very kindly removing themselves."

bex.6.d:0 "Terrible news has swept in from the Home Isles, as it has emerged that our King, Edward VIII was beheaded in front of a large crowd in the Tower of London. He has now received a civilian burial instead of one in the Royal Vault and we are now without a King. Edward had been besieged in Buckingham Palace from the early days of the Revolution and finally dragged out after the massacre of the King’s Guard and the storming of the Palace in the final days of the Revolution. The title of King now falls to his brother Albert, who was more fortunate, being in loyalist-aligned Scotland at the time of the Revolution. While reluctant to take the throne, he will be taking assuming it under the regnal name ‘George VI’ in a coronation that is to occur within the next few weeks in Alexandria."

bex.7.d:0 "Zadok The Priest rang out again today as another British monarch in a long line of succession took the Throne of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Although the Coronation was not conducted in Westminster Abbey, George VI was crowned with a substitute crown in the same ritual that has been performed in largely the same manner for a thousand years. The Coronation instead took place in the far smaller St.Mark’s Anglican Church in Alexandria, a lucky survivor of the British bombardment of 1882. The small church made up for its size with grand Byzantine architecture contrasting heavily with the Gothic architecture of the usual location of the Coronation, although this displeasured many Exiles as they perceived the building as Islamic. \n\nAlbert was presented to a group of exiles and loyal natives, and acclaimed by them, before swearing to uphold the law of the United Kingdom and the Church of England. The also newly instated Archbishop of Canterbury anointed Albert with holy oil, and Albert was then dressed in what regalia could be smuggled out of Britain during the collapse. Finally, Albert became George VI as he was crowned King by the Archbishop. His wife was then crowned Queen Elizabeth, Queen Consort, before a closing procession indicated the end of the ceremony."

bex.8.d:0 "During a meeting with Montgomery, the King expressed his displeasure at the continuation of military government, which he believed was to be just a temporary measure. He even stated that as Monarch he cannot legitimately rule over a military government, and expressed his desire for the establishment of a form of civilian government. As a staunch Royalist, this places Montgomery and the wider Junta in a difficult position, as they do not desire to dethrone the King or to give up their power. With what power the Junta has over the King, Montgomery must make a decision..."

bex.9.d:0 "The city of his coronation, it was easy enough to get the King to pack up and move to Alexandria as there is little he can do about it on such short notice. With the King out of Cairo, there is no longer a threat to military rule as he is now far away from the machinations of politics. A civilian government can wait for when the Home Isles are retaken." 

bex.10.d:0 "It has been two weeks since the King was reprimanded for sticking his nose into politics, and since then there has been total silence from George. He has not attended scheduled meetings with Montgomery, and he has not answered any letters or telephone communications. Aides of Montgomery have informed him that due to the King’s stutter and reluctance to take on the Kingship, it is likely out of timidity that he has been silent due to the strong reaction to his confrontation. He shall surely emerge from this quiet period in time, ready to act as a loyal public servant, rather than a meddling nuisance."

bex.11.d:0 "After weeks of silence from the King and non-attendance of meetings, members of the Junta thought that the issue of the King’s meddling had resolved itself. They were proved fatally wrong today. The defunct Egyptian Parliamentary Palace which had previously held the Shura Council and now held the Junta, has been marched upon by the King alongside a number of soldiers. With the King and the Kings men reaching the entrance of the architecturally British-style Parliament building they marched up to a number of soldiers who guard the entrance. These soldiers now await orders from the Junta..."

bex.12.d:0 "While the guards did loyally wait for orders, when they received them they unilaterally chose to ignore them, instead laying down their arms and joining the King! George VI and the soldiery that he has gathered with him now much into the Parliament building unopposed, and he surely has ill will for the members of the Junta..."

bex.13.d:0 "As the King entered, a group split off from him. They marched into the administrative quarters of the Parliamentary Palace where many Junta leaders, including Montgomery, reside. The soldiers declared these leaders under arrest, to which the leaders begrudgingly complied with little more they could do, and escorted them out of the building. The King meanwhile marched into the radio broadcast room, where the operators were demanded to stop what they were already playing. The King with a group of armed men stood around him, slowly started to speak into the radio. Although his stutter was still present, it was less so than usual, and the King was able to confidently announce to the public that he had dissolved the Military Junta, and now he had assumed power with a civilian government to be established in his name shortly. As soon as his speech ended, he shook the hands of the men who had helped him pull off this coup, and he marched out with them as quickly as he had came in."

bex.14.d:0 "In the months following the evacuation and establishment of the Government-in-Exile, we have witnessed the rise of a new movement that is rapidly growing popular among exiles going disaffected due to the failures of the army high command and the establishment. This movement, calling itself the ‘United Albion League’, arose from an intellectual secret society and has grown into a larger movement. The movement is nationalist, anti-egalitarian, anti-liberal, anti-democratic and intensely reactionary, while also claiming to desire the upholding of ‘Anglo-Saxon Liberty’. It advocates making strong moves internationally to make the reclamation of the Home Isles possible, rather than the focus of many in the Junta of trying to survive in hope that when a claimed ‘inevitable’ collapse of socialism in Britain comes the government in Cairo can step in. \n\nWhile currently they do not seem to constitute a great threat to our power, the membership of a number of intellectual and cultural elites as well as large scale membership of Great War veterans and active soldiers indicates they could very easily become one. They must be kept an eye on if we do not wish to find ourselves out of power."

bex.15.d:0 "Fear of socialism is at its height currently under the Cairo Government, and the United Albion League have capitalised on this with the recent establishment of the Anti-Socialist Volunteer Corps. Despite its neutral sounding name, it is directly linked to the party apparatus of the UAL. Members of this group have been terrorising suspected socialists, distinguishing themselves with British Military style uniforms, with Keffiyeh headwear common among Bedouins in the Sanai being worn which serves to hide identities. While we may like to shut down this organisation down immediately as violating our monopoly on violence, they have proved extraordinarily popular among the virulently anti-socialist exile population. Shutting them down would only increase the already rapid political momentum the UAL already has. For now, we must make sure their activities do not get out of hand."

bex.16.d:0 "The rise of the Albion League has led to a great amount of anxiety among the members of the Junta, as it seems like large sections of the army and elite – essential power brokers to maintain our rule – are falling into the clutches of the UAL. Montgomery has ordered his men to find any way shape or form that their momentum can be reduced. \n\nThe Junta’s prayers were answered today, as an intelligence dossier landed on Montgomery’s desk this morning detailing UAL and Paramilitary links among highly ranking members of the Junta, intelligencia and Royal Navy. With the heads of the UAL leadership on a platter, the Junta has spared no moment in arresting all figures detailed in the report. Now it’s just a matter of solving the mystery of who placed the report on Montgomery’s desk..."

bex.17.d:0 "The eruption of the sound of unrest outside the Parliamentary Palace today set leading members of the Junta in a haze of confusion and hasty planning as they believed that the Natives had all of a sudden gone back to a state of discontent. This was until they were politely informed by an aide who had bothered to look out the window that these were the white faces of British men and women. It was later found out that they were protesting the recent arrest of a number of UAL figures, many of whom had become extremely popular in recent months. At this moment, the Junta only see that they have to wait this out."

bex.18.d:0 "A shouting match erupted in the Parliamentary Palace as news broke of the escape of six of the seven imprisoned United Albion League leaders. It appears that they were let free by their captors, causing confusion as to whether this was just a random act by sympathisers or if this was their plan all along. If there was a plan clearly not everyone in the prison system was in on it, as a young recruit of just 18 years shot and killed the only leader not to escape, UAL founder and leader William Sanderson. The leadership has now fallen to one of the successful escapees, Anthony Ludovici, who along with the other five has gone into hiding, and the Junta can only wonder what move they are to make next..."

bex.19.d:0 "During the middle of the day, leading members of the United Albion League, led by Ludovici, alongside a large contingent of armed men in modified military uniforms marched down various Cairo streets before reaching the Parliamentary Palace. Intending to peacefully march into the parliament building and arrest the sitting government, they instead marched directly into the face of the soldiers guarding the parliament building. These troops now await orders from the Junta on how to deal with this armed threat."

bex.20.d:0 "A barrage of rounds from the Junta soldiers was not enough to put down the UAL forces, and now an intense gunfight has broken out in the streets of Cairo. The UAL leaders must now make a decision, whether to immediately try and overwhelm the defenders, or whether to be cautious in fighting Junta forces."

bex.21.d:0 "With the situation angst-ridden already, a warning shot from the Junta side did nothing to help the situation. Instead of resolving tensions, panic broke out which quickly resulted in a gunfight between both sides. Heavily outnumbered, the King and his men fought bravely but after a matter of minutes the King and his conspirators laid lifeless outside the Parliamentary Palace. The Junta has now fallen into a panic, with the regicide of the King collapsing their already strained popularity. What they do next is anyone’s guess."

bex.22.d:0 "The death of the King, while removing the greatest threat to the Junta’s rule, has destroyed any credibility they had among the exiles. With the potential of total collapse approaching, Montgomery has decided to hastily declare a Republic, replacing the King with the position of Lord Protector. Such an extreme measure has been done in the hope that with total power assumed the Junta may be able to wrestle control of the Exiles by force. "

bex.23.d:0 "With numbers on their side, the forces of the UAL were able to quickly overrun the soldiers of the Junta, with many Junta soldiers deserting in the middle of the battle due to the panic caused by the ferocity of the attack. After this, UAL forces marched into the Parliamentary Palace, seizing vital positions in the building and arresting the leaders of the Junta. Montgomery was dragged out into the streets of Cairo, and executed with a Webley Revolver by Ludovici for all to see. Ludovici then proclaimed to a gathered crowd that the United Albion League had overthrown the tyranny of the Junta, and would now be ruling in its stead."

bex.24.d:0 "As the battle raged on for longer and longer, it became clear that the UAL’s numerical advantage was not permanent. After the orders were sent out, a number of local Junta-aligned forces arrived at the Parliamentary Building, and before long the battle turned into a massacre. In the aftermath of the brutal fighting, the UAL leadership was found dead on the streets of Cairo, their bodies surrounded by their compatriots who aided them. No quarter was given to those who surrendered, and before long the streets of Cairo ran with rivers of blood. Montgomery proceeded to announce on the wireless that the traitors had been destroyed, and that the ruling government was here to stay."

bex.401.d:0 "While the government in Cairo has had little contact with us thus far, they have now opened full relations with us, expressing their desire to restore the fraternity of the British Empire and to reclaim the homeland."

bex.402.d:0 "American forces march victoriously through the streets of Ottowa, as the Canadian government finally surrendered to the overwhelming US force. While resistance remains intense, it is clear now that Canada is lost and will be no use to us anymore."

bex.403.d:0 "The fall of Denmark has seen socialist Britain seize the strategically important Danish North Atlantic. The islands are now totally in their grasp, and we will be unable to claim these islands from the Danes ourselves."

bex.405.d:0 "Limited British support for the socialist Spanish has turned into total intervention, as an alliance has now been made by the British and Spanish socialists, and British troops arrive in Spain en-masse.

BEX_convoy_escort_desc:0 "Britain is an island that relies heavily on goods imported from the rest of the Empire. These convoys need to be protected during war time, but we can’t risk valuable battleships on this relatively minor mission. We need to create a newer model cruiser, light enough to keep pace with the convoy ships but with enough fire power to deter enemy ships and U-boats."
BEX_mobile_squad:0 "Mobile Squadrons"
BEX_mobile_squad_desc:0 "With an Empire as large and expansive as ours having the largest and heaviest Battleship only serves to allow us to defeat our foes, but only if we catch them first. Building upon the Battlecruiser philosophy of the Great War we will create a new generation of vessels with armament equal of any Battleship, but with the speed to catch maurading vessels harassing our trade routes."
BEX_fast_bb:0 "Fast Battleships"
BEX_fast_bb_desc:0 "As the Admiralty places a new emphasis on speed rather than superior armament, a new class of Battleships will need to be developed. Ships emphasising speed and expediency for dealing with threats across our vast Empire as they arise."
BEX_bc_refit:0 "Battlecruiser Refits"
BEX_bc_refit_desc:0 "Our current roster of Battlecruisers are relatively outdated, with some still focused on the theories of the Great War. In order to ensure our supremacy in this area we must refit our Battlecruiser fleet with the latest in naval technology."
BEX_escort_killers:0 "Escort Killers"
BEX_escort_killers_desc:0 "If we intend to starve our enemies of supplies, as we did so effectively in the last war, we will need to furhter our Battlecruiser designs and set them loose upon the high seas with the goal of destroying enemy trade wherever it is found."
BEX_inter_tactics:0 "Interception Tactics"
BEX_inter_tactics_desc:0 "Pioneering new theories on intercepting any trade across the seas will allow our fast battleships and battlecruiser squadrons to effectively hunt down and destroy enemy convoys, successfully strangling the enemy into submission."
BEX_nav_course:0 "Naval Construction Courses"
BEX_nav_course_desc:0 "While our engineers and craftsman are some of the best in the world, they could be better. Creating new technical and engineering schools with a focus on naval construction techniques will ensure that we remain the dominant nation in naval construction across the globe."
BEX_mod_nav_cons:0 "Modern Naval Construction"
BEX_mod_nav_cons_desc:0 "Our incentives have drawn many men from across the Empire to come and aid in the construction of naval vessels. With this influx of new talent we can direct our efforts to formulating new techniques to expediate the building of our larger naval vessels."
BEX_cls:0 "Destroyer Command Vessels"
BEX_cls_desc:0 "While our squadrons of Destroyers operate well against enemy submersibles, the Admiralty has inquired into the possibility of creating new Cruiser vessels to defend our ASW operations from larger threats that would normally dispatch our Destroyers with ease."
BEX_subs:0 "Undersea Raiders"
BEX_subs_desc:0 "With their efficacy proven in the Great War, the Admiralty has in the previous decade made many strides towards creating new and more deadly submersibles. As our position becomes increasibly threatened by nearby belligerent powers we must actively direct efforts towards updating and modernising our submarine fleet."
BEX_rbritannia:0 "Rule, Britannia!"
BEX_rbritannia_desc:0 "When Britain first, at Heaven's command\nArose from out the azure main;\nThis was the charter of the land,\nAnd guardian angels sang this strain:\nRule, Britannia! Britannia rule the waves\nBritons, never never never will be slaves!"
