#### Ideas ####

NOR_socialism_surrounded_idea:0 "Socialism Surrounded"
NOR_socialism_surrounded_idea_desc:0 "We, the Republic of Norway are ruled by a socialist government, surrounded by conservative and nationalist regimes. To the west, the British Empire rules our seas. In the south, the Danes are waiting to attack and give the throne to the former king. In the east, the Swedes see a chance to reassemble the union, but with them leading it all. And in the north, the White Finns are rebelling against the Soviet Union. We need to preach unity and defence in a time where we truly are surrounded by countries wanting us dead."
NOR_monarchist_right_idea:0 "The Monarchist Right"
NOR_monarchist_right_idea_desc:0 "Since the abolition of the monarchy in 1926, the liberals and conservatives have been the main supporters for pro-monarchist choices. This was shown when president Hambro allowed the marriage between the crown prince, Olav, and the Swedish princess, Märtha, to take place in the capital of Oslo. While the bourgeois parties have played by the 1926 constitutional reform, they are not scared of showing their monarchist positions. Many leaders in AP want pro-monarchist actions outlawed and be sentenced to prison, to crush this move!"

NOR_war_on_samfundsvernet_idea:0 "War on Samfundsvernet"
NOR_war_on_samfundsvernet_idea_desc:0 "Samfundsvernet was created by the bourgeoisie as a weapon against the working class in 1923. This hasn’t changed since then. They were outlawed on New Year's eve of 1931, but they have gone underground. Lead by NS officers, they are a great danger to the country and have many times tried to start a civil war in the country in the last five years. They are still a threat to the people and the state, and should be dealt with to prevent a civil war or a coup!"

nor.0.t:0 "The Republic of Norway"
nor.0.d:0 "Norway became independent from Sweden in 1905, exiting the union that was established between these nations. One of the first questions the people of Norway had before themselves was if we should become a constitutional monarchy or a republic. The people then, all of the men 25 years old and older, voted for the monarchy. Prince Carl of Denmark came to Norway as King Haakon VII.\n\nBut not everyone was okay with the monarchy. When the Great War waged on, the class differences helped the worker movement to grow in our country and, after the war, the working class had become poorer and the upper class richer. With the ideas of Karl Marx, it was all laid down for revolution. Many can say it started with Denmark's turn into a dictatorship under their king. The fact that this king was King Haakon's brother was reason enough to get the workers up into a strike. The Oslo Strike was a protest against capitalism and monarchy. It was for the most part peaceful, but where it got violent was proof for many politicians in Arbeiderpartiet that the state and police were after them.\n\nThis was also the time when Martin Tranmæl emerged in Norwegian politics. He was the front-runner for the abolishment of the monarchy in 1926 and was a natural candidate for president. He represented the main opposition towards president Hambro. In 1930, Martin Tranmæl, for Arbeiderpartiet, won the presidential election while his comrades formed government.\n\nSince then, Arbeiderpartiet has yielded huge power. But their power is not eternal. There are potential enemies all around the nation, Sweden, Denmark and the emerging power in Germany. At the same time has monarchism and nationalism risen in the country. There is an increasing danger of militant groups taking power. With all the changes in the world, the upcoming election can be a new turning point in Norwegian history."
nor.0.a:0 "Evig og Tro til Dovre Faller!"
nor.1.t:0 "17th of May - Constitution Day"
nor.1.d:0 "It is the 17th of May, constitution day. This day is marked every year by both children and adults marching in the towns, waving their flags. All this is for celebrating the day when our constitution was signed into law, 17th of May 1814. Since then, the constitution has been changed. But the core material has mostly survived, making it one of the oldest constitutions in the world."
nor.1.a:0 "Hurra! Hurra! Hurra!"
nor.2.t:0 "17th of May - Constitution Day"
nor.2.d:0 "It is the 17th of May, constitution day. This day is marked every year by both children and adults marching in the towns, waving their flags. All this is for celebrating the day when our constitution was signed into law, 17th of May 1814. Since then, the constitution has been changed. But the core material has mostly survived, making it one of the oldest constitutions in the world."
nor.2.a:0 "Hurra! Hurra! Hurra!"
nor.3.t:0 "London Crash Affects us too!"
nor.3.d:0 "Some days ago, the stock market in London crashed. Some of the members of the government and many in society said that we would not be affected. But we did. After members of the Continental Entente, today stopped all investment and all trade with us, we are not completely ready to deal with this problem. Already has unemployment risen and the state-owned companies are demanding more money and resources. The enemies of the government have already begun to blame us. We must just wait what the news will be filled with tomorrow."
nor.3.a:0 "Tranmæl Holds a Speech Promising Growth and no ties with Capitalists!"
nor.3.b:0 "Christensen Holds a Speech Warning Against Government Interference!"
nor.3.c:0 "Quisling Holds a Speech Blaming the Socialists to have ruined Norway!"
nor.4.t:0 "Crisis in the Economy"
nor.4.d:0 "It seems that the unemployment rate has stopped going up and that we have been lucky in contrast to the situation in Britain. But it is not perfect here either. The worst is that the election is up in just a few days, and many say that this incident will sway the voters away from Martin Tranmæl and Arbeiderpartiet."
nor.4.a:0 "It can't get worse at least!"
nor.5.t:0 "Landslaget for Norske Jordbruksklubber"
nor.5.d:0 "Since the 1920s there has always been an idea to get the youth interested in agriculture. The idea itself comes from the American organization 4-H. The rural clubs that have grown have now got together to organize. While some radicals see this as agrarian propaganda, president Tranmæl has shown his support for this."
nor.5.a:0 "Clear Head, warm Heart, good Hands and good Health!"
nor.6.t:0 "Rockfall in Loenvatnet"
nor.6.d:0 "Bad news has arrived from the towns of Sogn og Fjordane Amt. Not so many hours ago, a huge bit of the mountain Ramnefjellet slid down into the lake, creating a 70-meter high flood wave that destroyed many nearby farms and killed 74 peoples. Many peoples are now waiting for the president to give a speech, showing his concern for the affected families and friends."
nor.6.a:0 "Rest in Peace!"
nor.7.t:0 "Alt for Kongen's Peoples March"
nor.7.d:0 "When news from England came, giving the news of the birth of Prince Harald, son of Crown Prince Olav, the monarchists were not late to organize protest against the Republic. Lead by Rudolf Ræder, once leading member of Frisinnende Venstre before the party merged into Høyre, and now self-proclaimed leader of the monarchist movement, the monarchists marched in the capital of Oslo, mocking both the republic and the Oslo strike. What are we going to do about this?"
nor.7.a:0 "They will be tired soon."
nor.7.b:0 "Arrest so many you can!"

nor.10.t:0 "Election Campaign Begins"
nor.10.d:0 "When Norway became a republic, the president got the job to declare when an election campaign should begin before the election. Today, president Tanmæl has proclaimed that the election campaigns for the 1936 election can begin. Speeches will be held and posters will be hung up.\n\nArbeiderpartiet will this year focus on healing the divisions on the left, but wings of the party have a different program, that may make the party break apart. Venstre will campaign for the reprivatization of 'stolen' businesses and their own welfare plan. They hope to get both liberals and social democrats to support them. Høyre will campaign for the privatizing of important businesses and the monarchy. They wish to get conservative liberals and nationalists to support them on this. There are minor parties, but these are the most important."
nor.10.a:0 "Interesting Every Time."
nor.11.t:0 "Nasjonal Samling Involved in the Election"
nor.11.d:0 "The political party Nasjonal Samling has for the last elections played a minor role, sometimes not getting involved in them at all. But today Vidkun Quisling, the party's leader, held a speech in front of Stortinget, our national assembly. He was joined by some of his party comrades and attracted around 200 passersbys. Quisling declared that he will be more involved in the election, and if he and his party are not allowed to participate, it would show the government's undemocratic nature. The police are ready to arrest Quisling after his speech."
nor.11.a:0 "Arrest Him!"
nor.11.b:0 "Let us Not Prove Our Undemocratic Nature to Him!"
nor.12.t:0 "Radical Socialists are Protesting"
nor.12.d:0 "Because of our acceptance over Quisling's speech that was held some days ago, many radical socialists, labour unionists and communists are protesting this in front of Stortinget. Many of them want to see the right-wing parties banned, with their posters saying: 'No Quisling, No Ræder, No Mogens!'"
nor.12.a:0 "Maybe a Ban could Work."
nor.13.t:0 "Samfundsvernet Protest Quisling's Arrestation"
nor.13.d:0 "Because of the recent arrest of Nasjonal Samling leader Vidkun Quisling, many of those who have been suspected to be members of the right-winged militant group called Samfundsvernet, have protested in the streets of our capital city and surrounding towns. They are also spreading 'lies' about our government. That we arrest nationalists and try to arrest or assassinate conservative voices in parliament. Police have already been sent in."
nor.13.a:0 "Maybe we should Strengthen this Fight!"
nor.14.t:0 "Election Day"
nor.14.d:0 "The time for campaigning is over. The election date is here finally. Today, we will see the will of the people play out. Some has said that this could become another victory for Arbeiderpartiet. Martin Tranmæl is still an inspiring figure in Norwegian politics. He is certain to win a third term as president, or give his position to a new, hopefully as uniting, figure. Others have faith that a new government will be formed. Both Venstre and Høyre has good chances this year, and many have blamed the Madsen government for the economic instability. Some would like to see Mowinckel or Christensen as the new president in Norway.\n\nThe president also has the power to cancel the election if he sees the situation to hold one to dangerous. But this choice would be very unpopular, and many believe it would only help the right-wing in our country gaining support. Let us see what's happens."
nor.14.a:0 "While Losing some Support, Arbeiderpartiet still Wins."
nor.14.b:0 "Stealing votes from AP and Høyre has made Venstre victorious."
nor.14.c:0 "Høyre managed to win both the centre and the right."
nor.14.e:0 "Stop this election! It weakens National Security!"
nor.15.t:0 "Arbeiderpartiet's New Government"
nor.15.d:0 "Arbeiderpartiet has won the election and it is now time to choose who shall lead the government. There are two possible option, Peder Furubotn, who wants closer ties with the internationalist vanguardists and to spread socialism in Scandinavia, or Aksel Zachariassen, who wants to heal the bond between the party and the social democrats, and wants to protect democratic values."
nor.15.a:0 "The Radical Furubotn!"
nor.15.b:0 "The Moderate Zachariassen!"

nor.16.t:0 "Mass Protests Against the Canceled Election!"
nor.16.d:0 "Canceling the election seems to have been a pretty bad idea. People all over the country are in protest, and places in the conservative Western Norway are in open revolts. There are also revolts beginning to grow in other regions. Many are now turning to the radical right to make them 'save' Norwegian democracy. Nearly everything is set for a coup or civil war."
nor.16.a:0 "May God Help Us!"

nor.17.t:0 "Military Deserters"

His presidency will alienate some of our most moderate members, so it might not be the best choice.\n\nJohan Nygaardsvold does in reality represent Norges Socialdemokratiske Arbeiderparti, a party that broke off Arbeiderpartiet back in the 1920s. His presidency can result in a party merge, but can also alienate the radical wing of the party."
