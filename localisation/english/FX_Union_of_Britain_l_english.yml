UOB_eco_revival:0 "A National Trade Union"
UOB_eco_revival_desc:0 "While small unions will not be absorbed, many of the larger trade unions will be reformed into a large national union, establishing a direct connection between the state, worker and union, as a transition until the day all are one."
UOB_eng_lives:0 "Re-Ratify the English Bill of Rights 1689"
UOB_eng_lives_desc:0 "After James II dissolved parliament and attempted to establish a continental-style absolute monarchy, he was removed in the bloodless Glorious Revolution in 1688. To ensure such a thing could never happen again, the English Bill of Rights of 1689 was drafted to protect English freedoms. Since then the document has fallen into obscurity, and now with a new revolutionary government it may no longer be valid. We shall ratify it again to ensure tyranny never takes hold again on these blessed isles."
UOB_marches_on:0 "Regional Autonomy"
UOB_marches_on_desc:0 "There have been serious complaints from our Celtic brothers that much like the old Conservative and Unionist Party, we are an English-centric party. Such accusations have even gone to the level of accusing us of being reactionary! To dispell such rumours we will establish small Welsh and Scottish legislative bodies, with a level of local powers."
UOB_diss_aristo:0 "The Wealth of the Aristocracy"

The Norman Conquest of 1066 saw our rightful freedoms taken away by a continental power, and since then we have spent nearly 1000 years trying to get these freedoms back. Now, thankfully, we are entering an age where we can truly declare ourselves deserving of being proud of our Anglo-Saxon Freedom."

UOB_socialist_nation:0 "National Socialist Majority"
UOB_socialist_nation_desc:0 "Many shout and sneer in the Congress and the National Socialists claim victory. On their platform of national security and socialism within one country they have sailed into power, likely due to post-revolution anxiety that it may all come crashing down."
UOB_no_gods:0 "Destroy the Church of England"
UOB_no_gods_desc:0 "Since the reformation the British people have spent hundreds of years divided between Catholics, Protestants and Nonconformists. Many in the socialist movement are nonconformists therefore, while we have an official policy of atheism, in the name of national unity and party unity we will target Anglicans primarily."

UOB_rebuild_britain:0 "Peoples Welfare"
UOB_rebuild_britain_desc:0 "While it will be at much cost, a vast welfare state will endear much of the public to us. These services will also allow us greater control, giving us access to medical records, turning health issues into one in the public domain, and taking apart the family structure through offering large amounts of benefits to mothers, replacing husbands with the state."
UOB_control_eco:0 "Expanding the Bureaucracy"
UOB_control_eco_desc:0 "Whitehall was never going to be big enough to run our state. Historically the Englishman has only been used to having the state in his life through the mere postman and bobby. He will come to accept that the state is now in every part of his life."
UOB_self_reliance:0 "The Death of Privacy"
UOB_self_reliance_desc:0 "The idea of the private citizen is deeply baked into the British psyche. We will not only destroy this mindset, but create a class of informants everywhere, so that no one feels safe so dissent."
UOB_emergency_measures:0 "Emergency Measures"
UOB_emergency_measures_desc:0 "Britain is still in chaos, and we need to assert greater control as previous measures have not been sufficent. A set of emergency powers will be brought in to allow the state greater control over the economy, military and civilians lives."
UOB_new_britain:0 "A Secure Britain"
UOB_new_britain_desc:0 "While we still have much to do, Britain now stands as a country far safer than before we rose into power. The streets are quiet and orderly, the church has been neutered, and foreign powers have backed off. A new, secure Britain has finally replaced the old disorderly one."

UOB_navalbuild:0 "Naval Buildup"
UOB_navalbuild_desc:0 "As an island nation, the most important part of our defense is control of the seas. After much of the Royal Navy fled during the Revolution or was scuttled, our control of the seas is a shadow of what it once was, with even the French Navy larger than the Republican Navy. The creation of new dockyards and laying down of new ships shall amend this grave problem."
UOB_notrade:0 "The Black Island"
UOB_notrade_desc:0 "Trading with reactionaries makes them strong and us weak and reliant. If we are to survive we must cut ourselves off from the rest of the world and live an autarkic existence, otherwise we could be devestated by a blockade by a foreign power in wartime."
UOB_britain_alone:0 "British Isolationism"
UOB_britain_alone_desc:0 "As an island in the North Sea with a large naval history Britain has always greatly engaged with the rest of the world.

UOB_reclaim_irelandtwo:0 "Annex Ireland"
UOB_reclaim_irelandtwo_desc:0 "Ireland has a 700 years of history tying it to the island of Great Britain. If we allow it to drift away it may fall into the hands of a foreign rival, threatening our survival. This cannot be allowed to happen, Ireland must be reintegrated by any means necessary."

UOB_reclaim_ireland:0 "Reclaiming Ireland"

As the rightful successor state to that Kingdom, we can rightfully annex Ireland and bring the light of socialism to their shores, preventing any reactionary threat to our nation from there."
UOB_bring_france:0 "Bring the Revolution to France"
UOB_bring_france_desc:0 "The history of France, from the French Revolution to the Paris Commune, shows they have great revolutionary potential. Unfortunately, cowardice has got in the way many times and the nation now stands as a reactionary republic. If the French worker will not liberate himself, we will do it for him."
UOB_strike_beneleux:0 "Strike the Low Countries"
UOB_strike_beneleux_desc:0 "Attacking the Low Countries can provide us a doorway into Europe, through which we can further spread the revolution."
UOB_socialist_ireland:0 "Socialism in Ireland"

UOB_crush_valkism:0 "Crush the Valkists!"

UOB_secure_nsea:0 "Securing the North Sea"
UOB_secure_nsea_desc:0 "As an island in the North Sea, it is essential for us to control the North Atlantic and North Sea. We must seize the Scandinavian Island possessions, and form alliances where we can."
UOB_destroy_exiles:0 "Destroy the Cairo Government!"
UOB_destroy_exiles_desc:0 "The Exiled King in Africa, despite the weakness of his position, has proved to be a great thorn in our side. Cairo's control of the Gibraltar Strait and Suez Canal has cut us off from the Mediterranean and forced us to use the Cape of Good Hope to access the East. The government also provides much hope and support to the remaining reactionaries in the British Isles. We must crush this relic of the past once and for all."

UOB_sov_split:0 "Healing the Anglo-Soviet Split"
UOB_sov_split_desc:0 "Since the foundation of the Union of Britain, we have largely ignored the existence of the Soviet Union, seeing them as a potentially reactionary force due to their lack of industrialisation. Our divide was cemented with the establishment of a Fourth Internationale rivalling the Soviet Third Internationale. Now, it is becoming more and more difficult to them as our spheres of influence get ever closer. Now we must ask what we will do in regard to the Soviet Union."

UOB_build_forts:0 "Industry for Defence"

UOB_rebuilt_britain_desc:0 "After much work the British economy is taking shape to be congruent with our vision. We are entering a new economic age where what was considered economic common sense and consensus for the last 100 years has been dismissed in favour of a new economic regime that ensures the survival of British socialism."
UOB_new_corn_laws:0 "New Corn Laws"
UOB_new_corn_laws_desc:0 "The repeal of the Corn Laws by Peel in 1832 allowed the import of cheap grain from America, causing grain prices to greatly reduce and food supplies to greatly increase. This enabled an industrial revolution and population boom, and of course Capitalism. However, it destroyed British farming, removing the peasant from the farm and placing him in the workhouse, while making us reliant on foreign nations for our food supplies. With modern agriculture technology and participation of civilians by encouraging them to 'Dig for Socialism', a return of the Corn Laws will not necessarily reduce food stocks too greatly. Marrying these laws with other protectionist laws for steel, coal and other resources alongside state intervention will see a growth in output of these domestic industries to make up for the reduced supply to demand ratio created by a removal of foreign competition."
UOB_expand_mining:0 "New Mines"
UOB_expand_mining_desc:0 "The humble British miner has served our country well, but it has not been good enough. To make us ready for the next war we must dig far deeper, in far greater number, to assure our war machine will be an effective one. Many across Britain will resent the tearing up of the countryside in favour of new mines, however there is little they can do to stop it."

UOB_revival_a:0 "Incomes Policy"

UOB_infrestructure_a:0 "Expanding British Rail"
UOB_infrestructure_a_desc:0 "By the turn of the 20th century our rail network had reached its peak in Britain, with little laying of lines since. However with a greater focus on the army as opposed to the Navy by our new government as well as greater need to transport goods domestically, new lines must be built and existing lines expanded. With the destruction of the aristocracy it will be far easier to get permissions to make lines through land."
UOB_infrestructure_b:0 "The Motorways"
UOB_infrestructure_b_desc:0 "While the motor car is not currently available to the masses unlike in America, in the future it is likely to become highly important.

UOB_pro_worker_policy:0 "Policy for Workers"
UOB_pro_worker_policy_desc:0 "While the state forms only a small and military role in our economy, we can use that scope to gain much advancement for the worker.

UOB_begin_purge_desc:0 "Since the end of the Great War, the general public has lost interest in the army, reverting to the traditional love of the navy after the public were shocked by the brutal battles of the Somme and Ypres. This has resulted in this being reflected in the general state of the army in Britain both before and after Revolution. The Revolution, after all, was enabled by mass disloyalty within the British military. With our shift to focusing on the army compared to the pre-revolutionary government, we will enact a range of sweeping reforms to be able to face the kind of wars we will be expecting in the coming years."

This will be one in which no soldier will have to march miles to reach his destination, where our men will be safe behind inches of steel, and one where pure speed will overwhelm even the quickest reactionary. These ideas are bold, but we believe this will give us an edge on any other military in the world."
UOB_doctrine_of_autonomie:0 "Doctrine of Autonomy"
UOB_doctrine_of_autonomie_desc:0 "While the high command will still play an important role in leading our armies and uniting them as one, we will give greater powers of planning, organisation and decisionmaking to our officers. In a rapid war, where tanks cut through enemy lines at lightning fast pace, to properly exploit advances we cannot rely on a few to be able to properly coordinate the many."
UOB_cult_of_offensive:0 "Cult of the Offensive"
UOB_cult_of_offensive_desc:0 "Our doctrine pays little concept to defence. In lightning fast revolutionary wars, defence is unneeded. Training our men to advance as fast as possible, with as much vigor and power as they can muster will bring us to victory. In our conception of war, there is only attack and attack and attack some more."

uob.500.d:0 "Local residents stared in horrified silence as York Cathedral bathed in flames. Residents of the surrounding medieval Shambles and Bootham had been awoken by a bright light from the 700-year-old Cathedral cutting through the black night. The silence of the crowd was cut through by the roar of fire and faint sounds of laughter and smashing emerging from the interior. \n\nInside were scenes of abject debauchery and violence. A large group of youths had lit the flames, and inside they were joyfully smashing their surroundings illuminated by flames, their shadows dancing across the interior. The Archbishop of York lay face down on the smashed remains of a stained glass window near the altar, with his clothes half torn off posthumously, with three large, bloodied knives standing erect from his back. 3 youths marched about carrying a centuries old body of a priest, roaring with laughter, before growing disinterested and throwing the body into a pile of burning bibles and pews, only to resume binge drinking. To the side of the aisle were the sounds of ecstasy from two young adults, as they engaged in what they saw as a revolutionary act of lust as Victorian morality and tradition burned around them. \n\nBy the morning, only the skeletal remains of the centuries old Gothic cathedral remained. Much like the night before, the streets of York had become deathly quiet, with residents going about their days in a state of shock. Their feelings of humiliation and horror from the actions of the youths were compounded with the knowledge that with the Revolutionists in power, little could be done to stop or avenge actions like this."
uob.502.d:0 "Oliver’s teeth chattered and his hands shook as he slowly marched in line with the other prisoners into the gates. He did not know where he was and did not expect to find out. All he knew is he was a long way away from Somerset. He thought of Amy, his love, and prayed that she too had not been spotted plastering anti-socialist posters around the recently socialised Wells Cathedral School. The other prisoners looked at him strangely, some hardened soldiers, some more refined, none as young as him. \n\nA piercing cry of ‘Halt!’ cut through the whistling wind and light rain. A thin, tall man wearing a battered brown cap and uniform stepped forward and surveyed the prisoners. Silence held for a tense minute until it was shattered by a short, booming speech in a provincial accent: ‘You will be assembling artillery shells for the Republican Army. This is dangerous work, but it will be made more dangerous if you do not listen to your leaders or refuse their orders. If you do not work, you will be punished all the way until the greatest punishment that can be issued. If you work, you may in time be considered rehabilitated and will be able to return home. You will be attending classes that will assist in this rehabilitation. Now follow your assigned leaders to your quarters!’ \n\nWith that, several other men stepped forward and began leading prisoners away to the beginning of their lives at the camp."
uob.503.d:0 "‘Bristol! Really?!’ Cynthia loudly protested. ‘Look, its just for a few months, I’m sure...’ Oscar quietly attempted to reply, before Cynthia slammed the offending draft papers on the table. ‘We’ve only been married seven months, lived in Yatton our whole lives, now you’re being sent to that bloody city, and for what? World Revolution? You’ll all die trying.’. Oscar stared back blankly. There was nothing the couple could do, with the numerous protests against such drafts put down quickly by mobs of pro-revolutionary zealots and drafts enforced harshly on pain of being accused of being reactionary. \n\nBoth went to bed that night in silence. Another word was not spoken until the tearful goodbyes next morning, and then Oscar stepped apprehensively onto the back of a lorry, potentially never to be seen again."
uob.504.d:0 "Seconds after the Sergeant’s whistle shrieked a ragtag group of men began stumbling their way across a makeshift obstacle course made up of felled trees, dilapidated brick walls, barbed wire and hanging bars. Despite their light loads of equipment, their incompetence was made bare. After a group of men tripped over one another and plunged into the mud beneath their shaking feet the Sergeant’s whistle let out a second cry. All movement stopped as the Sergeant began screaming a combination of insults and frustrated cries until his voice became hoarse. He finally blew the whistle again, indicating he wanted them to run the course again. \n\nHe sat down on a nearby bench and exhaled loudly. While a convinced socialist he longed for the days before the war where the men were fit, professional and could do the same course wearing 150 pounds of kit. This ‘peoples army’ was little more than stumbling amateurs. It would require a gargantuan effort to shape these men into soldiers, an effort he wasn’t sure he had in him after the Revolution. After seeing the men stumble once more, he shot up into standing again, recomposed himself, and resumed the screaming of various insults at the now broken men."
uob.505.d:0 "The overwhelming sounds of sneers and jeers of a gathered crowd swirled around Edward, the cruel sounds emanating from a small 1x1 foot barred window. Edward had only ever previously viewed the Tower of London as a place where the Crown Jewels reside. He felt stupid to have viewed it with such a level of insignificance, as he now himself resided in the Tower, but in a minuscule, dank cell rather than the Jewel Tower. \n\nFate had it that he would not be there long. A loud knock on the vast black steel door gave way to a large figure walking in along with several others, grabbing him and taking him away. As soon as the former King overheard a mutter of ‘let's get this over with’ he started protesting, demanding at least an hour of final prayers before he met his end, before the sting of a baton silenced him. \n\nAfter what seemed like a decade of walking, Edward and his unfriendly entourage emerged into the exterior, where a large crowd has gathered. A light drizzle dashed him from the pig-iron grey clouds above as he was slowly marched along a sturdy wooden platform to a bench in the centre of the court. Denied a final speech unlike the last King to be executed here, he instead slowly surveyed the crowd with a face of silent but harsh judgment, before being gestured to take his place on the bench. As he rested face down, staring at the wooden stand he heard heavy footsteps land next to him, and he caught the glimmer of sharp steel beside him. It was then raised, and there was a short tense moment before a short sharp pain before Edward was at peace."
uob.505.a:0 "Another Tyrant in the Mud!"
uob.506.d:0 "The removal of the exiles from mainland Britain has seen an unprecedented transfer of men, materiel and machinery from the British Isles on the vast ships of the Royal Navy. The Exiles were able to evacuate a large amount of this machinery and capital to Cairo and now we face the concequences of this evacuation."

#natsc
uob.501.d:0 "For years Richard’s family had the same routine for Sundays. In the morning was Church. The whole family walked together along the winding tree-covered country lanes to arrive at the modest priory, where together they prayed to the almighty, safe in the knowledge that at the end of this life they could spend eternal bliss together. After church was Sunday lunch, and the family visited their grandparents in their ramshackle detached house on the edge of the village to eat as one. Finally, in the evening was Sunday Roast, and the family assembled wearing their Sunday Best to gorge on roast potatoes, beef, gravy and boiled carrots. \n\nThings had changed since the Revolution. With the scars of war, food had become scarcer. The grandparents had gone missing a few weeks after the war, and now the house was occupied by a young couple from London, now schoolteachers at what was the local Church of England school. The Church was now boarded up and closed after the government took a hammer to the Anglican Church. What they did have was Sunday Roast. \n\nHalfway through eating on one fateful night, Richard slammed his fists on the tape. His wife immediately fell into weeping, knowing what this was about. Richard pointed at his beloved children and forcefully told them ‘I will never allow you to accept this evil government. They are an affront to God and all that is good in the world. I know I have told you in the past to respect authority, but this is not a legitimate one. What they teach you in that school, you must ignore. If we were allowed to home school you, I would, but for the love of God don’t listen to a word!’ The table once again fell into silence, as Richard’s two children stared at him blankly, before all slowly resumed eating."

# the revolution
uob.3.d:0 "As the situation in Britain intensifies, more and more soldiers are crossing lines as the split in the military deepens. Soliders cross lines, ships sail from their ports into Revolutionary controlled ports and planes take off from reactionary airfields never to return. We now have a sizable professional force with which to face the government."
uob.4.d:0 "Alongside defectors now stand masses of armed workers, ready to fight and die for the revolution. Momentum is on our side and the revolution is now unstoppable!"
uob.5.d:0 "The last few weeks has seen a standoff between us and the government. Many began to question whether we were serious about the revolution, or would accept a comprimise for mere pay rises. Their foolishness has been exposed today as across Britain revolutionary forces lauched a devestating attack on government forces. The Revolution has begun!"
uob.6.d:0 "As remaining reactionary holdouts are destroyed and reactionaries drop from the gallows, it is clear that the revolution has been victorious! The future in socialism in Britain is uncertain however, and many questions must be addressed before we can build our Jerusalem."

# The Power Struggle
uob.7.t:0 "The United Congress of British Workers"
uob.7.d:0 "Now that the dust has settled and the guns gone quiet, it is time to go about implementing socialism in this country! Numerous conflicting views on how best to do this fly through the masses, with heated arguments and even political violence resulting. To stop this disunity from spiralling out of control, the revolutionary vanguard under Clement Attlee has convened a Congress in the old Palace of Westminister. The old traitors and reactionaries of the Palace have been executed or imprisioned, and now the newly inaugurated Palace of British Wokers sets to work healing these divides so that a responsible government can lead the revolution into the future. \n\nThree main factions in the Congress have emerged. The §RRevolutionists§!, who seek nothing less than world revolution, and believe that Britain is in the best position to lead such a revolution. Internally, they broadly advocate a light amount of central planning combined with strong worker autonomy and union power. The §RUnionists§! form a second faction which advocates a moderate approach to socialism and revolution. They argue for a retaining of ancient Anglo-Saxon liberties, with a moderate amount of central planning and worker autonomy. This is married to a foreign policy advocating European Revolution and military reforms that favour politicisation of the military. The third and final faction are the §RNational Socialists§!, who advocate for sweeping nationalisations, central economic and military planning, an isolationist foreign policy and a level of British nationalism."
uob.7.a:0 "Let the Congress begin!"
uob.8.t:0 "The Economic Debate"
uob.8.d:0 "The first matter the Congress will address is that of future economic policy. There has been bitter arguing among the ranks over what socialism should look like, whether Lenin's policies in Russia have been correct, whether Marx and Engels should be reinterpreted, with these furious debates only interrupted by members nodding off during lengthy Das Kapital readings. \n\nAfter much debate, the 3 factions have united amongst themselves along 3 broad positions. The Revolutionists argue light central planning to keep the revolutionary machine going, while at the same time providing large amounts of worker autonomy, with military quotas dictated to autonomous unions. Meanwhile, the Unionist faction argues that a certain amount of central planning is required to prevent reactionary ways of economic organisation from fermenting, while at the same time a large amount of worker autonomy should be provided and the liberties of these workers safeguarded by strong trade unions. They believe in a large expansion of infrestructure both as a make-work scheme and as a way of streamlining British industry. The National Socialists argue for large scale central planning, with centrally assigned quotas for production dictated by a vast bureaucracy that can fine tune the economy. They also argue for strong self-reliance, desiring to achieve this through further prospecting for resources across the British Isles and North Sea, and expanding farming so that we cannot be brought to our knees by a blockade as the Germans were in the Great War."
uob.8.a:0 "Central planners know best."
uob.8.b:0 "The workers know best."
uob.8.c:0 "A mixed economy is preferable."
uob.9.t:0 "The Foreign Policy Debate"
uob.9.d:0 "The next matter on the agenda of the Congress is that of foreign policy. Britain is very much isolated, as a lone beacon of socialism in Western Europe, with extraordinarily poor relations with the only other major socialist power, Russia, arising from historic mistrust and a lack of political or materiel support for the revolution. \n\nFrom this dire situation have arisen 3 proposals. The Revolutionists argue in favour of a world revolution led by Britain, in which we will first achieve a European Revolution, before moving on to the rest of the world. The Unionists argue for a contained revolutionary policy, arguing in favour of the carving out of revolutionary sphere of influence in Western Europe. The National Socialists believe in a staunchly isolationist foreign policy, closing off Britain from other socialist powers and wanting little more than the reintergration of Ireland so that Britain can build socialism in peace."
uob.9.a:0 "We must consolidate socialism in Britain"
uob.9.b:0 "The revolution must be spread to the world!"
uob.9.c:0 "Western European revolution will guarantee our security."
uob.10.t:0 "The Military Debate"
uob.10.d:0 "With much of the Republican Army's finest killed during the revolution, the Royal Navy mostly evacuated to Cairo, and the Republican Air Force in disrepair, a change of policy is needed or the light of the revolution may be snuffed out. \n\nTo address this 3 proposals have dominated the Congress. The Revolutionists argue in favour of a doctrine of autonomy, in which officers and generals have a large amount of say seperate from the High Command and political institutions. They advocate a mobile form of warfare in which revolution can be successfully achieved in a short amount of time with minimal casualties through a motorised and armoured army. The Unionist faction believes strongly in a politicisation of the military to ensure a strong culture of socialism among the armed forces through the establishment of political commissars and strong civilian oversight of the military. Alongside this they advocate a military doctrine of combined arms and artillery, arguing that the lessons of the Great War inform such a strategy. The National Socialists argue for a highly centralised military bound to the central government. Such a military will be able to escape little from civilian oversight and intervention, with a rigid command structure within the military itself allowing little to no autonomy for officers and generals. They advocate a large amount of planning to go into the operation of the military, advocating for central planning in the military in a similar style to their proposed centrally planned economy."
uob.10.a:0 "We must centralise the military to ensure our security."
uob.10.b:0 "Mechanisation and autonomy are the future."
uob.10.c:0 "Civilian oversight and combined arms will lead the way."
uob.11.t:0 "The Debates Come to a Close"
uob.11.d:0 "After weeks of intense debate the arguments have finally ended with majorities voting in favour of each policy. Now that the policies are selected, Attlee will announce which faction, if any, has assumed a majority in the Congress."
uob.11.a:0 "Finally!"
uob.12.t:0 "National Socialist Victory"
uob.12.d:0 "Dominating the debates, the National Socialist League of Britain has assumed a majority in Congress. The new Chairman Jock Haston has much work ahead of him, with the establishment of vast new institutions and mass centralisation to take place."
uob.12.a:0 "Grand."
uob.13.t:0 "Revolutionist Victory"
uob.13.d:0 "Dominating the debates, the International Revolutionist League has assumed a majority in Congress. Clement Attlee has retained the position of Chairman. After leading Britain successfully through a revolution, many hope that he will be just as successful in leading the country out of it and into the world."
uob.13.a:0 "Reactionaries around the World tremble."
uob.14.t:0 "Unionist Victory"
uob.14.d:0 "Dominating the debates, the British All-Union Socialist League has assumed a majority in Congress. The new Chairman Arthur MacManus has much work ahead of him, as major reforms must be undertaken to achieve the Unionist vision of socialist Britain."
uob.14.a:0 "Grand."
uob.15.t:0 "A Hung Congress"
uob.15.d:0 "After the numerous debates in Congress, no clear majority has emerged. Infighting is beginning to increase again, with verbal insults and threats thrown across the chamber and in the streets. Attlee must make a comprimise with the Unionists or National Socialists if British socialism is to survive..."
uob.15.b:0 "Comprimise with the Unionists"
uob.15.a:0 "Deal with the National Socialists"

uob.16.d:0 "The British have demanded our North Atlantic possessions. These demands are naturally outrageous, however we are in a vulnerable position. If we do not hand over these islands and prepare for a confrontation, other nations may smell blood in the water and start issuing demands. What shall we do?"
uob.17.d:0 "The socialists in Britain have demanded Greenland. This is a threat to our security which must be responded to!"
uob.18.d:0 "The British and Canadians seem to be enjoying themselves carving up the North Atlantic between themselves. While we do not currently have the naval means to stop them, we can take advantage of the situation by attacking the now isolated Denmark."
uob.19.d:0 "Our demands were initially rejected by the Danish, and we began preparing the fleet for a war in the North Atlantic. However, since then Germany and Canada have joined in with making demands from Denmark, and now the small nation faces three foreign powers. With overwhelming odds, they have ceded Greenland to the Canadians, with Iceland and the Faroe Islands going to us. The small nation now faces the wrath of the Germans, and there is little that can be done to stop them."
uob.20.d:0 "The British and Canadians have got what they want, now it is our turn. We shall liberate Schleswig-Holstein from the Danes and place a friendly government up North."

uob.21.d:0 "Today, the government in the Union of Britain announced that the 'World Revolution' has begun, and then listed every nation state in the world one by one, before informing all these states that the Union of Britain is now at war with them. The world is now united against the British and their revolutionary allies, and now only time will tell if we can stop the world from falling to socialism."
uob.22.d:0 "The Soviet question has been one of the greatest questions to be ignored in British politics. However, it can be ignored no longer, as our European influence stretches to the Soviet Union. We must now decide on a final policy on the Soviets."
uob.23.d:0 "For a long time, one of the greatest threats to Soviet Socialism was the British. With the fall of Britain to socialism, we thought that threat might have subsided. Today, we have been proven disasterously wrong, as Britain has declared war on our nation."

## alliance events
uob.800.t:0 "Britain invites us to the Fourth Internationale"
uob.800.d:0 "The recently established revolutionary government in Britain has sent us an invitation to the Fourth Internationale. While the letter on the surface is a polite invitation, it reads much like an ultimatum, and many in our government wonder if the British will take no for an awnser, likely due to our vital position in regard to the Exile controlled Gibraltar. How do we respond?"
uob.800.a:0 "Spain stands with the British worker!"
uob.800.b:0 "We will not kneel to the perfidious albion"
uob.801.t:0 "Spain accepts our invitation!"
uob.801.d:0 "The Spanish stand with us, partially due to solidarity and the great help we can provide them in their dire situation, and also likely due to the strong wording of the invitation. We now stand in a position where we can threaten Gibraltar if hostilites were to break out between us and the Cairo Government again, making our naval situation far better."
uob.801.a:0 "We're fortunate they saw sense!"
uob.802.t:0 "The vile Spaniards refuse!"
uob.802.d:0 "Our history with Spain is a colourful one, and we should have expected that they would refuse our alliance due to past animosity. We are now in a difficult sitation. Spain is essential for us to take, as it provides the gateway to the Mediterranean and an opportunity to strike Gibraltar. We can attack Spain, likely an unpopular move at home, or leave them be."
uob.802.a:0 "We weren't asking"
uob.802.b:0 "We've had quite enough leftist infighting"

uob.803.t:0 "The British invite us to the Fourth Internationale"
uob.803.d:0 "Until now we have been cautious with the British socialists. Until now we have been an isolated force of socialism in Europe, and now one of the major European powers and our greatest pre-revolution trading partner falls to socialism. They now extend a hand, asking for alliance. Do we accept?"
uob.803.a:0 "Let us stand with our British comrades"
uob.803.b:0 "Isolation is what kept us safe"
uob.804.t:0 "The Norwegians Accept our Offer!"
uob.804.d:0 "Norway is now a full member of the Fourth Internationale. It is fortunate that we will not have to fight them for control of the North Sea, and now our influence in the region and by extension Scandinavia is cemented."
uob.804.a:0 "Hurrah!"
uob.805.t:0 "The Norwegians Refuse!"
uob.805.d:0 "Norway has refused, stating they do not wish to be dragged into any wars and are best off alone."
uob.805.a:0 "Bugger"

uob.806.t:0 "Britain invites us to the Fourth Internationale"
uob.806.d:0 "For a long time it seemed like the British were the greatest threat to Soviet socialism. Now, after fighting many of the countries that have most threatened us they seem more like an ally than a foe. They now offer us an alliance, although we must remain suspicious of their motives. How do we reply?"
uob.806.a:0 "We stand with the British worker!"
uob.806.b:0 "The British are not to be taken seriously"
uob.807.t:0 "The Soviets accept our invitation!"
uob.807.d:0 "After a tense wait, the Soviets have finally announced that they will be joining the Fourth Internationale. The Anglo-Soviet split has been healed and we can look forward to a new age, an age of socialism!"
uob.807.a:0 "We stand side by side with the Soviet worker"
uob.808.t:0 "The Soviets Refuse!"
uob.808.d:0 "Since the days of the Great Game in Asia we have been a foe of Russia, with the alliance during the Great War being only a temporary respite from this situation. Now after we have extended a branch of friendship, they have refused. What shall our policy be now?"
uob.808.a:0 "Kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crumbling down"
uob.808.b:0 "We've had quite enough leftist infighting"
