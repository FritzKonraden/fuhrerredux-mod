BUL_FUHRERREDUX_DESC:0 "The young Bulgarian nation joined the Central Powers in the Great War, declaring war on Serbia in October 1915; despite achieving its territorial objectives, the capitulation of the German Empire proved to have catastrophic effects as Entente forces took back its hard won gains.\n\nThe monarchy was abolished with the capitulation of Bulgarian forces; and the new Republic finally surrendered to the Entente, humiliated and torn apart in the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1920."

#NRP TREE
BUL_rule_of_NRP:0 "Rule of the NRP"
BUL_rule_of_NRP_desc:0 "The National Republican Party has ruled since 1934, but now only for the first time does it have in its hands absolute power over the Bulgarian state. Dochev and his men intend to use this power to reshape the Bulgarian nation and state to prepare it for revenge against the victors of the last war."
BUL_eliminate_remaining_monarchists:0 "Eliminate the Remaining Monarchists"
BUL_eliminate_remaining_monarchists_desc:0 "While many in our movement harbour monarchist sympathies, now is not the time for weakness. We must strike what remains of the monarchist movement, lest they rise to be able to challenge our authority once again. There can be no room for division."
BUL_eliminate_remaining_democrats:0 "Eliminate the Remaining Democrats"
BUL_eliminate_remaining_democrats_desc:0 "The vile remains of the democratic movement must be wiped clean from Bulgaria. From 1919 to 1934 these democrats set about plundering the remains of the Bulgarian nation intent on making personal gains for them and their friends at expense to the Bulgarian people and nation. No longer shall these thieves and liars be allowed to walk through the streets untouched. They will be removed and there will be little memory of them."
BUL_abolition_of_parliament:0 "Abolition of Parliament"
BUL_abolition_of_parliament_desc:0 "There is no need to keep the dead institution of parliament around. It is utterly dominated by us, and has no further use other than accepting our diktat and allowing subversion from what is left of the opposition. For the sake of formalising our absolute rule, this institution will be wiped away."
BUL_nationalisation_of_war_industries:0 "Nationalisation of War Industries"
BUL_nationalisation_of_war_industries_desc:0 "The previously governing Union for Democracy and later Second Concentration fully embraced the ideas of market liberalism. These ideas are an open door for decedance and weakness. We cannot leave the national defence up to the idea of 'the market'. We must put these industries in our hands, to run as we see fit, for the sake of establishing a Greater Bulgaria."
BUL_mass_mobilisation:0 "Mass Mobilisation"
BUL_mass_mobilisation_desc:0 "While Dochev is young and has not yet served, one thing him and his compatriots understand from their paramilitary wings and activities is how to mobilise vast numbers of people into action. This must be done on a national scale, and the Bulgarian people must stand ready for war."
BUL_bulgarian_nationalism:0 "Bulgarian Nationalism"
BUL_bulgarian_nationalism_desc:0 "Bulgarian nationalism must be central to the identity of our people. We must fight back against notions of Yugoslavism, localism and internationalism. Every person and matter must be raised to a national level, and this must not go above or below. The average Bulgarian must see themselves as part of a greater mass that is the Bulgarian nation."
BUL_winning_the_economic_war:0 "Winning the Economic War"
BUL_winning_the_economic_war_desc:0 "Military restrictions of the past continue to show their legacy in our futile industries. While we avoided the worst of the London Stock Market Crash, our industry remains unprepared for warfare. We must enact serious reform if we are to claim Greater Bulgaria."
BUL_raise_paramilitaries:0 "Raise Paramilitaries"
BUL_raise_paramilitaries_desc:0 "While Dochev has only taken control of the party recently, this doesn't mean the NRP hasn't been doing important work for a long time. Since the mid-1920s, the party has prepared for the day that it might rule, and one of the ways it did this was by creating well trained paramilitaries on par with professional forces so that we can quickly expand our military. With the restrictions rebuked, we shall use them to bolster our forces."
BUL_the_state_perfected:0 "The State Perfected"
BUL_the_state_perfected_desc:0 "The Bulgarian State is now a well oiled machine that utilises every available means that will bring it closer to achieving a Greater Bulgaria. The Bulgarian State truly embodies the Bulgarian national motto in a new way 'Unity Makes Strength!'"

### Events ###
bulgaria.1.d:0 "The 20th century began with a seemingly ascendant Bulgaria, newly independent and on the path to achieving the dream of ‘Greater Bulgaria’ which had been the primary foreign policy aspiration of the Bulgarian people and state since the Treaty of San-Stefano in 1878. However, this dream crumbled before the Bulgarian people’s very eyes throughout the next few years. Victorious in the First Balkan War, Bulgaria despite having the largest contribution to the victory was betrayed at the Treaty of London by its erstwhile allies, with the lions share of Macedonia going to the Serbs and Greeks. Infuriated by this betrayal, Bulgaria declared war on Serbia and Greece, starting the Second Balkan War, before being repulsed and attacked on all sides, with the Romanians and Ottomans attacking Bulgaria, before the four powers divided Bulgaria between them.\n\nSurrounded on all sides without Great Power support, the situation of Bulgaria was dire until an opportunity arrived: The Great War. Bulgaria declared war on Serbia in October 1915, aligning itself towards to the German Empire. Despite achieving its territorial gains, Bulgaria was unable to extract itself from the war. German military collapse in 1919 saw the Bulgarian army fall into mutiny as Entente forces took back its hard won gains. Tsar Ferdinand abdicated the throne in the chaos, and indecision caused by cautiousness on the matter of taking the throne by his heir, Boris, saw the monarchy abolished and a republic declared. This republic surrendered to the Entente, and saw itself torn apart at the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1920."

bulgaria.2.d:0 "We have signed a pact of alliance withh Hungary against Romania, under the pretense that we would be given back the lands of Dobrudja in victory. Now Hungary finds herself at war with Romania, and they are calling upon us to join them. Shall we honour our treaty?"
###
bulgaria.3.d:0 "The 1920s was a time of turmoil in the Bulgarian Republic, albeit with total continuity in government throughout. The post-war rise of radical socialist and nationalist parties saw the forming of a democratic coalition by the Democratic Party, Radical Democratic Party, National Liberals and the People's Progressives. This bloc was referred to as the Union for Democracy, but merely functioned as a way of maintaining the power, status and advancing the interests of the governing elite. Vast losses in 1930 by this bloc to Ivan Dochev’s National Republican Party saw the internal divisions of the bloc ignite. This led to its rapid collapse and the forming of the Second Liberal Concentration of the National Liberals and the People's Progressives, named after Vasil Radoslavov's Liberal coalition.\n\nThis was not enough to save liberal rule in Bulgaria, as in the 1934 Bulgarian election the National Republican Party swept to victory in a minority government, with the liberals unable to form a coalition to prevent this. Now Dochev’s party is rapidly growing its grip on power, and through assassination, payoffs and friendly appointments, the days of Bulgarian democracy seem numbered. Standing in their way is the remnants of this Liberal Concentration, vying to restore dominance of the Bulgarian state to their hands. On the side-lines, monarchist loyalists also aspire for power and placing Boris on the throne, and may prove troublesome in the coming months as the National Republican Party attempts to assume total power over the Bulgarian state."
###
bulgaria.4.d:0 "Defeated in 1919, Bulgaria was thrown to the wolves of Serbia and Romania by the Entente as a consolation prize for their disappointments in Dalmatia and Transylvania respectively. These two powers, along with the perfidious Greeks, tore apart Bulgaria at the tables of Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1920 while the Entente powers stood and watched the proceedings with little care for Bulgaria’s wretched fate. \n\nAlong with numerous humiliations such as financial reparations, military restrictions and a demilitarised zone encompassing Bulgaria’s South, vast territorial losses were suffered by the nation of Bulgaria. Serbia moved its entire Bulgarian border Eastwards, even taking the city of Vidin in this illegitimate and vile advance. Romania snatched Southern Dobruja and more, almost reaching the city of Varna. The Greeks stole Bulgaria’s Aegean coastline, along with various other border adjustments, even attempting to go further and annex what is now the demilitarised zone. While they failed due to Romanian and Serbian disagreements alongside a lack of British backing, they still lay claim to the region to the present. \n\nInfuriated by these losses, the Bulgarian people ready for the next war, one where this time they will not fail to achieve Greater Bulgaria. One, where Bulgaria’s enemies who took her apart at Neuilly shall face retribution in the form of overwhelming Bulgarian arms."
###
bulgaria.5.d:0 "The continuity of the 20s was crushed in 1934 as the young Dochev seized power electorally from the stagnating Second Liberal Concentration. This did not see the end of democratic opposition however, nor did it see the end of wider of opposition, as monarchists among more insignificant groups are vying for power. While the Bulgarian Republic’s days seem numbered for Dochev takes total control, it may come to pass that another group make take the opportunity to dominate. We must tread carefully in this climate and remember who our friends and enemies are..."
###
bulgaria.6.d:0 "Today, Dochev announced the official end of the Bulgarian Republic, and its replacement with a new Bulgarian State. This coincided with the announcement that various forms of opposition to the state are now illegal. Various ideologies and belief in them have been criminalised, such as socialist and democratic beliefs. NRP paramilitaries patrol the streets of Bulgaria, ensuring compliance with this new diktat. The lack of meaningful resistance to these acts have been taken as the implicit consent of the Bulgarian people. The NRP now have total control, and the nation marches towards confrontation with its neighbours."

#Foreign Events#
bulforeign.1.d:0 "Bulgaria once again is showing the world why it is referred to as the ‘Prussia of the Balkans’ – brutal militarism. While we could easily stand aside and allow the two foes to fight to the death, the end of this war may result in a strengthened Bulgaria – one that may prove a great challenge to our nation as it is likely they will lay their eyes on our lands in the future. To prevent this, we have been presented by proposals by members of our government and military to pre-empt Bulgarian aggression and intervene in the currently ongoing war. While this may not be a popular option, it is certainly safer than kicking the can down the road."
bulforeign.2.d:0 "The London Stock Market Crash has not only seen a global impact in the field of economics, but has also left the world witness to a diplomatic revolution as British hegemony quickly unravels. This has landed right on our doorstep, as British support of the Greeks militarily and diplomatically has dissipated as Britain announced the end of its guarantee for Greek independence due to attempts to reduce the financial burden of the British military and reduce the strain of global diplomacy on Britain’s finances. Due to the interests of Greece in the region they have generally been seen, with British backing, as the enforcer of Bulgaria’s treaty requirements in the South of Bulgaria, namely of the demilitarised zone. With British support gone and Greece in economic turmoil, it may be the perfect time to march our troops into this region, announcing our rejection of this treaty requirement."

#Flavour Events#
bulgariaflavour.1.d:0 "Since the end of the Balkan Wars, Bulgaria has constantly struggled with diplomatic isolation, deprived of Great Power protection since the diplomatic realignment of Serbia and Russia. Surrounded by enemies, the Great War saw Bulgaria find safety under the wing of the Prussian Eagle. This was not to last however, as the defeat of Germany in 1919 saw Bulgaria once again left without a protector, with dire consequences once Bulgaria’s neighbours descended on the nation. \n\n The success of the Valkist movement and the aforementioned historical ties to Germany have lead Dochev to seek renewed ties with the nation. Meeting Adam Dressler as well as a number of leading Valkist figures in Berlin, Dochev expressed the importance in establishing ties and their ability to protect Germany’s interests in the Balkans. After the two Heads of State finished their discussions, Dochev was given a tour of the nation’s capital, showing off some of the great works undertaken by the Valkist state.\n\n The visit concluded with the two Heads of State agreeing to a future of partnership and friendship. Many in the Bulgarian government have questioned this however after the visit, citing the differences between Valkism and the potential of positive relations between Serbia and Germany."
