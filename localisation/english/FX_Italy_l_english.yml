### History
ITA_FUHRERREDUX_DESC:0 "The Great War pushed Italy to her breaking point. Despite standing as one of the victorious powers following the conflict the nation was on brink of a civil war. Radical groups on both ends of the political spectrum were pushing for conflicting societal changes that threatened to tear the nation apart. Compromise between the Socialists and the newly founded PPI brought much needed reforms to Italy but many of the core conflicts of this era still remain."

#### Ideas ####

ITA_umberto_ii:0 "Victor Emmanuel III"
ITA_umberto_ii_desc:0 "The "Soldier King" reminds the Italians of their recent victories in the Great War. His presence and their loyalty to him is a great source of unity for many people in Italy but a growing republican movement, coming from both the Far Right and the Left, may undermine this core figure of Italian nationhood."

ITA_colonial_administration:0 "Colonial Overextension"
ITA_colonial_administration_desc:0 "After the Great War Italy was awarded many new colonial holdings but they are very expensive to maintain. Libya, our largest colony, has been embroiled in the devastating guerrilla conflict since the early 1920’s. Until some sort of solution can be found to bring this war to an end a massive garrison will be needed to keep Libya from slipping out of Italy’s grasp"

ITA_decentralization_conservative:0 "Autonomy for Sicily"
ITA_decentralization_conservative_desc:0 "The Island of Sicily has for a long time been under Spanish control and with many differences from the mainland. When we proclaimed a united Italian state, criminal organisations and bandit squads started to form in Sicily. Those bandits and mafias then started to spread and increase in power. Most of the bandits were eventually defeated by the Central Government, but the criminal organisations became smarter and started to work in secret. To this day, the Mafia is still an issue and the language differences are a barrier to say the least. With the newest resolution passed by congress, Sicily will be granted more autonomy to give their people better representation and to hopefully wake up the Sicilians and make them fight the Mafia."
ITA_decentralization:0 "Regional Decentralization"
ITA_decentralization_desc:0 "The lands of our nation have always been divided in some way since the fall of Rome. First the nation was divided between longobards and Byzantines, then the Franks came and took their slice. The Spanish also wanted a piece and in the end, the Austrians couldn't resist either. Centuries of foreign occupation made our people speak, act, or sometimes even look different. Now that Italy is one, we need to acknowledge those differences and make them our strength. After various talks at the parliament, and the approval of the King, regions will be formed. Each region will have special powers given by the constitution that they must respect. The newly formed regions are Abruzzi-Molise, Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Dalmazia, Emilia-Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Lazio, Liguria, Lombardia, Marche, Piemonte, Puglia, Sardegna, Sicilia, Toscana, Trentino Alto Adige, Umbria, Valle D'Aosta and Veneto."

From here we can organize and gather strength, far away from the German menace. Sadly not many Italian soldiers were able to make the journey to North Africa and the locals do not sympathize with our cause, both of which have led to a severe lack of manpower."

ITA_political_radicalization_desc:0 "Despite once being a source of stability for Italy, the Italian People's Party lead coalition that has been in power since the early 1920’s has begun to lose the support of the people.

ita.0.t:0 "The Kingdom of Italy"
ita.0.d:0 "In 1914 as Europe was finding itself embroiled in the first major war of the 20th century Italy remained neutral, at least initially. The Pact of London promised Italy land in the Balkans in exchange for military support against the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary. With this agreement Italy had joined Entente Cordiale dragging her people into war that many were sure would be over by Christmas. Despite seemingly being on the edge of collapse after several recent defeats Austria-Hungary put up a formidable defense against the Italians. The Italian front collapsed into the same stalemate as seen in France. It took the Entente until 1919 to defeat the Central Powers but even as a victor Italy was not unscathed. \n\nSocial strife that had been building in Italy for years exploded as soldiers returning from the front were welcomed back to a home that could not provide for them. As Italy's economy crashed the Socialists, emboldened by the Russian Revolution, occupied the factories and fought to police, an era now known as the 'Red Biennium'. In response the Nationalists formed their own 'Squadre d'Aziones' as a paramilitary force to deal with this threat. As the prospect of civil war grew on the horizon the time for compromise and reform was needed more than ever. The once united Socialist party was divided on how to proceed in their goal to liberate the workers leading to Amedeo Bordiga and Antonio Gramsci to break off and form the Communist Party of Italy. The left wing of Italy never recovered from this division allowing the recently formed Italian People's Party lead by the clerical socialist Luigi Sturzo to make compromises with the more moderate Italian Socialist party. Several reforms supported by both parties expanded the rights of the workers within Italy including the right to vote for all Italian adults as well as legal protections for Italy's new minorities gained as a result of the Great War. \n\nWhile this era of compromise brought stability and economic growth to Italy through the 20's it's positive effect have begun to vanish. The PPI's 'Big tent' political stance no longer appeals to the party's demographic. Sturzo's left leaning politics have increasingly put him at odds with the party's catholic faction lead by the conservative Alcide De Gasperi. As the politics within Italy grow increasingly radical the PPI must adapt to the changing times or be lost to history."

Our compromises with the moderate Socialists is very unpopular with them, as they see Marxist theory to be antithetical to Catholic teachings. The growth of the far right movement in Italy is also seen by many as a sign that the nation is in need of a strong and reasonable conservative voice which fellow PPI deputy Alcide De Gasperi wishes to capitalize on. Struzo and his supporters though believe that compromise with the nationalists will only lead Italy to internal conflict as seen in the 'Red Biennium' of the early 20's."

Efforts by the PPI to help modernize Italian agriculture have helped alleviate this issue but at the expense of small farm owners who barely make enough to pay for their own land, let alone tools and machinery needed for modernization. As more established farming conglomerates continue to buy up farmland many farmers have found another solution. Throughout the south many farmers have joined the FISN founded Farming Syndicate, a union of sorts that aids it's members in financing land payments and machinery in attempt to slow down the monopolization of Italy's agriculture sector. While this National Syndicate is very popular with it's members it has become a breeding ground for far-right Nationalist thought and political violence, with several Syndicate members being tied to crimes against rival Socialist unions in the region as well as major privately owned institutions. Edmondo Rossoni, the secretary-general of the Confederation of National Syndicates, has made his support of direct action and political violence an open secret and clearly has no intention to keep his syndicates in line with the law.

Most of the democratic socialists wish to pursue a broader goal of decentralization for the regions of Italy. The Communist suggested to create Anti-Mafia militias squad to protect the people.

Debate rages to this day on the role of the king within Italian politics.

Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta is supported by many nationalists and centrists factions and is a beloved royal celebrity amongst the Italian people.

While the Entente seemed like an obvious choice for Italy back in 1915, today territorial disputes threaten to tear this alliance apart. As nationalist sentiment grows within Italy it's clear we can no longer let these issues be ignored. Nearly a million Italians live under French rule with no autonomy to protect their culture. In Africa the French have done their best to prevent Italian influence from growing, such as forcing the assimilation of Italian settlers in Tunisia who even to this day still out number French settlers in the region. On top of this many within Italy doubt France's ability to defend Europe from German aggression, going as far to say that an alliance with France is akin to a suicide pact. If we are to continue our current relationship with France we must settle these issues."

Very few within France would dare to cede anything to Italy but as their ally it may be in our interests to at least hear them out."

First in 1769 France annexed the island of Corsica but even more recently in 1860 the Duchy of Savoy and County of Nice, which had been historically Italian, were ceded by Peidmont-Sardinia to France for support in the former's goal to unite the Italian peninsula. While this may have been advantageous at the time many now see this as a clearly unequal treaty. Italy's official stance on the fate of these territories and the Italians within them has been vague to say the least. While some want the reannexation of Savoy and Nice most would rather see France guarantee them and their Italian culture legal protection and autonomy or maybe even a population exchange."

While the majority within these regions are French a sizable Italian minority does live within the area. Rome wishes for us to guarantee this population as well as the Italians in Corsica special legal rights and autonomy.

If we want to secure access to the world's oceans we will want to show our dominance over this choke point.\n\nMalta has been a long time nationalist claim for Italy, as Maltese culture is strongly intertwined with Italian culture. On top of this it's strategic location in the center of the Mediterranean means it's a threat to many of our shipping lanes and may be used as a base to blockade us from Libya.\n\nFinally the British bases on Cyprus are dangerously close to our own territories in Anatolia.

It's strategic position in the center of the Mediterranean is a key factor to the United Kingdom's control of the region, a fact well understood by the Italians who have offered to purchase the island. In the past this offer would have been quickly ignored but with the recent economic downturn it may be in our best interests to consider it. While in the age of sail having Malta as a naval base was a sensible decision, the invention of aircraft such as naval bombers puts any ship stationed at the island in a vulnerable position. The Italians and French both have large air basses well in range of Malta. Few in Britain see value in defending Malta when the larger and much more secure base in Alexandria can be used. If we have any interest in rapprochement with the Entente we may want to agree to sell Malta along with it's dated naval bases."

Both the Suez Canal and Gibraltar are our possessions, the strategic control of which is vital for our Empire. This situation has put us at odds with nations that depend on these water ways for their shipping needs. This brings in the Italians who have sent us a list of territorial \"guarantees\". In the event that The United Kingdom is no longer able to protect the security of it's empire, the Italians want our blessing to secure Gibraltar and Suez for the purpose of guarantying naval access to Mediterranean. In Britain the vague wording of the Italian document has some ministers concerned about it's hypothetical enforcement but advocates for it see this agreement with Italy as a solid first step towards rapprochement. The value that these waterways have for our empire can not go unstated. If we truly do seek rapprochement with Italy we may want to consider sending a counter offer, granting them some lesser Mediterranean bases."

While many great empires have attempted this in the past, the task was seemingly too much for the Franco-Italian alliance. Rome now seeks an alliance with us. An Anglo-Italian alliance would be a major shake up to the balance of power. Our combined navies would easily overwhelm France or Germany plus our two nation's location within Europe would force either of those powers into a two front war if needed. While this all sounds good on paper, if there is anything we learned from the Great War is that Italian ambitions severely out weigh their competency.

When The State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs joined The Kingdom of Serbia to form the Pan-Slavic state of \"Yugoslavia\" Italy pressured the victorious Entente powers to prohibit this union, fearing that it's pan-ethnic values would weaken Italian claims in Croatia. In a compromise between the two sides Serbia was granted these former Austrian lands but could not form a de jure Pan-Slavic state. This decision though did little to appease either side as it did not do much to address conflicting land claims. Today though Rome has denounced [GetName.SER] as a authoritarian back water that cares little of it's ethnic minorities. While no territorial claims were pushed forward by Rome it's clear this action was intended to hurt the legitimacy of Belgrade and to provoke conflict.

The Croatian Ustashe lead by Ante Pavelić seeks for the independence of Croatia and Bosnia by any means necessary. They have committed several terrorist attacks throughout [GetName.SER] and are highly organized but lack supply and proper training. While they seem like a good choice to covertly help us undermine the stability [GetName.SER] the Ustashe have made claims to our territories on the Adriatic in the past. The last thing we would want is an organized terror group within Italy. Alternatively we could support the Macedonian \"Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization\" or IMRO. This organization has existed since 1893 and has over the course of it's life supported both the independence of Macedonia and union with Bulgaria. In the past they have killed several high ranking politicians in Bulgaria and Yugoslavia but do to their decentralized nature have neen very quiet for the last few years.

The Greeks claim this was started by the Italians as a pretext to start a war and subjugate their nation, a claim that the Italians dispute.

Today this has come to it's logical conclusion as Rome has announced the annexation of our country as the newest Region of Italy. While some within the country are looking forward to the benefits of becoming full Italian citizens, most Albanians are enraged over the fact that once again our nation is being subjugated by our larger neighbors.

The recent Italian election gave the [ITA.GetRulingParty] enough legislative influence needed to support a popular socialist movement which has helped cement leftist control over the country. This has concerned Italy's reactionary neighbors who will look for any excuse to undo the liberation of the working class, as such Italy is looking for powerful allies like ourselves to protect their Revolution. The USSR has been isolated from Western Europe since it's inception and has missed out on the intellectual and monetary capital that the west has a near monopoly over.

Italy's desperation to become the dominating power within the Mediterranean had put her at odds with France in the past but many had hoped that their alliance would put an end to these squabbles but it seems the ambition of a growing Empire can never truly go away. Italy has now chosen to seek their own destiny separate from France. This development has put the fate of the Entente in question.

The most obvious region the Germans may attack is the Rhine. The French occupation of this region has been a sore spot in Franco-German relations and [GER.GetLeader] has made no secret of his desire to reclaim it. The Rhine river offers much protection but it is by no means uncrossable. Austria is also a region of German ambition. If they were to annex this region it would be a seriously blow to Italian security. We must not allow the Germans to flank our armies through the Alps.

During the Great War 5 million soldiers were part of the army, but the number has decreased since then and the new tactics we have learned during the war could help modernize our army. The spirit of the Duke of Victory Armando Diaz, whom passed away in 1928, is still living strong in the army and thanks to him Italian soldiers are no longer under equipped but this has also lead to complacency within the commanding officers which may weaken are ability to defend ourselves. Earlier attempts at modernization began when Italy started purchasing tanks from Britain in 1928 which has helped the Italian war industry advance quite significantly. FIAT is pushing for the implementation of newer, home built, tanks into the army so we can spare our soldiers the unprotected slaughter they were subjected to in the Great War but some officers believe that the one major reason for the Italian army's poor performance in that war was due to the lack of sufficient artillery. Instead of focusing on expensive and vulnerable tanks they think we should make sure our soldiers have advanced and powerful artillery to support their attacks. In Rome, collectivist politicians have influenced some army leaders to integrate the paramilitary/partisan Red Brigades into the army and push for the implementation of mass conscription and partisan warfare while the more conservative elements of parliament wish to give more autonomy to officers and generals who wish to create a strong, well trained and well equipped professional army spearheaded by powerful “Alpini” mountaineer divisions who are a great source of pride for the Italian Nation."

itafla.1.d:0 "Famed Italian anthropologist Giuseppe Sergi passed away today at the age of 95. For decades he taught at both the University of Bologna and University of Rome La Sapienza where his dedication to his field helped popularize and develop anthropology into the modern science we know today. In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in his works especially on the 'Mediterranean race'. As the German Reich continues to push propaganda on the superiority of the Nordic people many Italian nationalists have countered with their own theories of a unified Mediterranean race which can trace it's origins back to Rome, Europe's first great civilization. The far right Fasci Italiani del Sindacalismo Nazionale (FISN) party sees Sergi's writings as a cornerstone of their movement. As the Nordic nations of Britain and Germany continue to spread their influence into the Mediterranean the FISN will continue to promote their ideals of a united state in southern Europe built on the legacy of Rome that can combat these foreign invaders. Whether he is remembered as a nationalist hero or a promoter of the sciences, Giuseppe Sergi will go down as one Italy's most significant intellectuals."

The Communists, especially Togliatti, advocate for radical and immediate societal changes for Italy in the vein of The USSR, calling for the expulsion of the Royalty and the rapid collectivization of industry. The Socialists, fearing possible violent opposition and the collapse of Italy's vital alliance with France, instead support incremental reforms and compromises with Italy's existing power structures. To many on the far left Pietro Nenni and his fellow socialists are seen a traitors to the Revolution, Nenni himself even supported Italy's imperialistic entry into the Great War and even enlisted into the army.

As the leader of the ruling FISN party and the National Syndicalist movement as a whole his death has sent a shock wave throughout Italy and the greater European community. His leadership and powerful oratory skills were paramount in bringing the FISN to power and revolutionizing Italian society. Preparations are being made for his funeral in which his coffin will be wrapped in flag of the Timavo and buried in the impressive mausoleum of the Vittoriale, a fitting resting place for such a national hero.\n\nDespite the national mourning we must continue to look towards the future of the party. Both houses of parliament have convened for an emergency meeting of the Arengo del Italia to decide on whom will succeed D'Annunzio as Comandante of Italy. As important as D'Annunzio has been for the party his leadership was far from perfect. He was never interested in the minute details of running a party let alone an entire nation state, choosing instead to focus on his writing and philosophy. This has forced many within the upper echelon of FISN to handle the duties usually expected of a Head of State. Though it isn't publicly known many of his close associates suspect that D'Annunzio's drug habit may have been exacerbated by the stress of his new position and may be responsible for his sudden death.\n\nWith D'Annunzio's death a power vacuum has opened within Italy that many within the FISN are desperately trying to fill. It will be some time before a new Comandante who can truly succeed D'Annunzio will be found.

Second only to D'annunzio himself, Ambris' political theories are a cornerstone of the National Syndicalist movement. Despite this many of his opponents are critical of his socialist past and his suspected relations with the USSR.\n\nEdmondo Rossoni, Secretary of The Confederation of Fascist Syndicates, is another possible candidate. A staunch ally of labor he is beloved by most of the working class as well as Italy's trade unions. He is a powerful and ambitious man with many grand plans for Italy but his hostility towards industrialists and other members of Italy's upper classes has lead to him being labeled as a \"Radical\" by some of the FISN more conservative elements who wish to see class cooperation.\n\nTullio Cianetti, radical trade unionist, has been selected as the final candidate. Despite his young age compared to most of the FISN leadership his reformist minded politics may bring new life to the party. He is already seen as a trusted ally of Italian labor but unlike Rossoni he shows no hostilities towards Italy's upper classes. His opponents though are concerned about his connections to Germany, specifically his friendship with Otto Strasser who's economic theories are seen with much skepticism back in Italy."

Rome is seemingly aware of this and have at the behest of Italian Comandante Tullio Cianetti sent us a labor treaty which would allow Italian workers to easily move to and work in Germany. Cianetti has been on good terms with many officials in Germany including Otto Strasser whom he shares many of the same economic theories with.

ARMY_RODOLFO_GRAZIANI_DESC:0 "§GMilitary Dossier\n§GBorn:§W11 August 1882 Filettino, Italy\n§GMilitary Career:§WGraziani joined the Regio Esercito (Royal Army) in 1903 and was soon stationed in Italian Eritrea. His first taste of success came during the Italo-Turkish war where he was promoted to Captain. He would continue to command forces during the Great War where his efforts would lead him to become the youngest Colonel in the Italian Army. Following Italy's victory against the Central Powers in 1919 Graziani became very influential on the affairs of Italy's newly gained possessions. He became infamous for his willingness to use any means necessary to assert Italian dominance over the local populations. With help from the local Greeks and in Panfilia, Graziani lead a brutal suppression of Turks in the region accused of supporting the Turkish National Movement. In Italian Cameroon he defeated a short lived guerrilla movement, forcing much of the civilian population into concentration camps and burning down thousands of square miles of jungle in the process. In Italy he is seen by many as a great Pacifier but those who have been the target of his wrath call him a butcher. Graziani is deeply conservative and believes that strong and iron fisted authority is needed to solve Italy's internal problems.\n§GNotes:§W\n-Tyrannical Authoritarian\n-Unprepared for another 'Great War'\n-Politically ambitious"
