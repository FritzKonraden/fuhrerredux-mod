UKR_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "Following the collapse of the Russian Empire, the Ukrainian people sought to establish their own state along the Dnieper river. The German Empire briefly established a client state with the hopes of using Ukraine's vast fields to feed the Imperial Army, but was forced to evacuate the region following the German revolution in 1918. The Ukrainian People's Republic was re-established, and thrown into the chaos of the Russian Civil War. Coming out victorious against the bolsheviks, the Ukrainians seeked to distance themselves from Russia and create a unique Ukrainian identity wedged between Soviet Russia and a resurgent Germany. With tensions once more rising in Europe, Ukraine must place her bets and pick a side, or be lost to the annals of time."

UKR_shock_and_awe: "Shock and Awe"
UKR_shock_and_awe_desc: "Sometimes, using artillery fire is necessary not so much for defeating the enemy, as much as disorganising and discombobulating it. Effective campaign of such allows the enemy to show its weakness, which is why we should invest in artillery most effective in this department."
UKR_logistics_improvements: "Logistics Improvements"
UKR_logistics_improvements_desc: "Although our largely flat terrain is usually seen as a disadvantage, there is one key upside to it. That is, the ease of logistical supply. Taking steps to ensure we can keep continuously supplying our troops is our current chief directive."
UKR_reverse_engineering: "Reverse Engineering"

We should take steps to deploy our prototypes on the field."
UKR_utilize_motor_factories: "Utilize Motor Factories"

UKR_modernize_artillery: "Modernize Artillery"
UKR_modernize_artillery_desc: "There's little more effective in warring than a punishing barrage of firepower on any given target. Effectiveness of such strategies increases even further in the event of utilising specialized artillery in divisions. Which we shall do."

While meeting these standards will be costly in the short term, it'll allow us to improve our production in the long term."
UKR_weapons_production_lines: "Weapons Production Lines"

UKR_anti_air_and_anti_tank_desc: "Artillery has become more and more useful in warfare, so much so that many frontline battalions nowadays are exclusively based on punishing artillery fire.

UKR_science_of_war: "The Science of War"
UKR_science_of_war_desc: "As we march into the future, it becomes plainly obvious that new wars will rather be won using superior technology than any long-form trench warfare or “flood-wave” tactics.

# Navy
UKR_reinforce_crimea: "Reinforce Crimea"
UKR_reinforce_crimea_desc: "Crimea was always an important trade port for Ukraine, that's why we must be ready to defend this city with our Black Sea fleet. We should expand the harbour in Crimea."

UKR_carrier_prototypes: "Carrier Prototypes"

We must invest in naval bombers to gain an edge on big, bulky navies."
UKR_deploy_the_new_fighter_prototypes: "Deploy the New Fighter Prototypes"
UKR_deploy_the_new_fighter_prototypes_desc: "In recent years we've taken to developing our own Fighter designs, with some joint effort from our other allies. Our efforts have paid off, it seems. Testing has shown a very positive result. As such, we should deploy our newly developed aviation for mass production."
UKR_a_domestic_bomber_model: "A Domestic Bomber Model"
UKR_a_domestic_bomber_model_desc: "Bombers have been shown to be very effective in disabling various elements of the war machine of any given warring nation. Whenever the next major European war comes, and it will, we must be ready. Depending on the designs utilised by our suppliers (primarily Germany) is all well and good, but it isn't completely viable. As such, we must begin working on own designs."
UKR_strategic_bomber_prototype: "Strategic Bomber Prototype"
UKR_strategic_bomber_prototype_desc: "Bombing enemy production facilities and supply lines is a great way to stack the odds in our favour against better equipped and more numerous opponents.
