UKR_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "Following the collapse of the Russian Empire, the Ukrainian people sought to establish their own state along the Dnieper river. The German Empire briefly established a client state with the hopes of using Ukraine's vast fields to feed the Imperial Army, but was forced to evacuate the region following the German revolution in 1918. The Ukrainian People's Republic was re-established, and thrown into the chaos of the Russian Civil War. Coming out victorious against the bolsheviks, the Ukrainians seeked to distance themselves from Russia and create a unique Ukrainian identity wedged between Soviet Russia and a resurgent Germany. With tensions once more rising in Europe, Ukraine must place her bets and pick a side, or be lost to the annals of time."

As such, we must begin working on own designs."

UKR_subsidize_azovstal: "Subsidize Azovstal"
UKR_subsidize_azovstal_desc: "While it may sound redundantly obvious, it will be impossible to build an industrial region without the construction services to do so, as we are already finding companies struggling to meet the specifications of modern factories.

This effort should hopefully allow us to speed up the growth of our industrial capabilities."
UKR_kharkiv_weapons_factories: "Kharkiv Weapons Factories"

UKR_urbanization_programs_desc: "Many of our cities are old, and their infrastructure reflects this.

UKR_odessa_state_university_desc: "Much of our rural population was never able to receive any form of education, and this has gone a long way to entrenching the economic divides and advancement problems in our nation.

While it may prove costly, it is hoped that it will pay off in the long run."
UKR_new_industrial_areas: "New Industrial Areas"
UKR_new_industrial_areas_desc: "The most straightforward way to combat unemployment is to kickstart large public works projects the unemployed can participate in.

UKR_economic_recovery_desc: "Social problems always provoke political instability. Lots of peasants join Socialist, nationalist or Russian separatist movements because of awful living conditions. If we want to save Ukraine from collapse, we should start a recovery programme and help the poorest grain-growers in Central Ukraine, providing our population with the cheap electricity they require. For this, we need cash."
